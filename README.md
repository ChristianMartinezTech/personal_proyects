Folder to study and create personal proyects.

I'll be re doing the Holberton proyects in the "holberton_prep" with the objective of starting Holberton again with a solid foundation.

I'll cover the Headfirst C book execises in that folder, as complementary education.

In the future, I'll add a Platzi folder for coding exercises/examples found in Platzi courses.

The objective of these activities is tackle programming from man different angles and learning methods as I can, without losing foucs and organization.
